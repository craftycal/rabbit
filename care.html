		<h1>Basic Care Guide</h1>
		
		<h2 class="controle">Diet</h2>
		<div class="box">
		<p>Rabbits need unlimited access to hay and/or grass. <br><br>

They are fibrevores; which means first and foremost, they need fibre. Therefore the most essential part of any rabbit’s diet is both grass and hay.<br><br>

<span id="p-bold">Hay…</span> provides long-strand fibre, which is essential for a rabbit’s gut. It also helps to keep a rabbit’s teeth in order. Rabbit’s teeth grow continuously throughout their life and they need to eat fibrous foods in order to keep their teeth worn down. Rabbits that don’t eat enough hay develop painful spurs on their teeth, which if left untreated will make it painful for them to eat. They may even stop eating which in a rabbit is fatal.<br><br>

Rabbits will naturally graze all day long so they should always have access to fresh, good quality hay. You can purchase hay from local farm stores such as Rural Trading Post &amp; Sharpes. You can also find a variety of hay at pet stores.<br><br>

<span id="p-bold">Grass…</span> the fibrous content of grass keeps a Rabbit’s gut mobile. The action of them nibbling on grass is also good for their teeth.<br><br>

Please be aware however that rabbits cannot eat lawn mower clippings! The mower causes the grass clippings to ferment very quickly and this can be very dangerous for a rabbit. You can pick handfuls of fresh grass for your rabbits if you don’t have any that they can graze on. Just be sure to check it has not been sprayed first.<br><br>

<span id="p-bold">Vegetables…</span> Rabbits love green vegetables and a good guide is about a cup of fresh vegetables per day. Leafy greens are best such as Kale, Broccoli including broccoli stalks &amp; leaves, Silverbeet, Celery, Spinach and herbs such as Parsley and Coriander. Rabbits also love carrot tops, the carrot itself should be fed in moderation as it has a high sugar content so too much is not good for your rabbit.  Please be aware any vegetables that are high in water content are not great for your rabbit, iceberg lettuce in particular should be avoided. If you do feed your rabbit lettuce ensure it’s a small amount and your rabbit has access to plenty of fibrous food such as hay.<br><br>

<span id="p-bold">Fruit…</span> Rabbits naturally have a very sweet tooth and fruit is a great way to give them a treat. About 1-2 tablespoons of fruit a day is recommended. Rabbits love bananas, apples, grapes, mango and pears. Dried fruits are also great treats, for example raisins, dried pineapple, dried apricots and dates etc. Please remove the pips from all fruit where possible.<br><br>

<span id="p-bold">Rabbit Pellets…</span> The general rule with rabbit food is that the plainer it is – the better. Where possible avoid muesli style food and opt for a plain high fibre pellet.<br><br>

The best rabbit pellet brands available in NZ are Oxbow &amp; Burgess Excel. If you are buying from a farm store then the best brand is NRM.<br><br>

<span id="p-bold">Water…</span> Rabbits need access to clean drinking water 24/7. Depending on your rabbit’s preference, this can be in a heavy bowl (they tend to tip over plastic bowls), a licker bottle, or both. You should clean out and change your rabbit’s water container regularly.<br><br>

<span id="p-bold">Forage…</span> Several common garden plants are safe for rabbits to eat and they are generally good at knowing what they can and can’t eat. However, please only feed plants that you know are not poisonous to your rabbit and ensure they have not been sprayed with weedkiller or pesticides. As with any new food, add it in gradually to your rabbit's diet and keep an eye out for any changes in your rabbit’s poo, especially diarrhea. (If your rabbit has diarrhea contact a rabbit savvy vet immediately).<br><br>

Branches are great for rabbits to chew on and again this is good for their teeth. Try Willow or Taupata and fruit branches such as Apple. Flax is also good for them to chew on and will keep them occupied.<br><br>

<span id="p-bold">Caecotrophs…</span> As part of their normal diet rabbits eat a particular kind of their own droppings called Caecotrophs. They do this as they cannot extract all the vital fibre and nutrients they need first time around. Unlike the normal dry droppings you often see caecotrophs are shiny, sticky and smelly droppings. Rabbits eat these directly from the anus so you shouldn’t see them often. To see them occasionally is normal but regularly may mean your rabbit’s diet is either too rich or they are having problems eating them possibly due to obesity, large dewlaps, dental problems etc. You should contact a rabbit savvy vet if you have any concerns.</p></div>

<h2 class="controle">Housing</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>When it comes to housing your rabbit the general rule is the more space the better. Rabbits need lots of exercise!<br><br>

WRR has a <span id="p-bold">minimum</span> space requirement of 1m wide x 1m high x 2m long – this should include a warm dry ‘bed’ space of at least 61cm x 61cm
Most hutches available on the market are too small to be the only place for rabbits to live in. They can easily be adapted by permanently attaching runs or pens. Pens can be made more secure by adding a roof. If you have a secure property then you could use something as simple as bird netting or chicken mesh over the top. If you feel predators could be an issue you should use weldmesh.  
Areas of your home and garden can also be made rabbit proof so your rabbits can live free range. Feel free to message us for suggestions and advice!<br><br>

Rabbits are very tidy creatures and can be litter trained. You can use a cat litter tray (I find this works best) or the corner litter trays designed for rabbits. You can use many different things for litter – the best type of litter is recycled newspaper litter. A good idea is to line the tray with newspaper, put down the recycled newspaper litter and then put straw over top.<br><br>

Litter training is SUPER easy! Every time they poop just scoop it up and place it in the litter tray until your bunny gets the idea. If you find they aren’t choosing to pee in their litter tray then if you place a tissue in their pee and then place it under the straw in the litter tray this will help them know where to go.<br><br>

If you are planning on having indoor – litter trained rabbits then you need to “rabbit proof” your house. Rabbits love to chew cords – whether they are plugged in or not… to save your bunny getting shocked and your wallet in replacing cords we recommend having any cords tied up and well out of bunny reach!</p></div>

<h2 class="controle">Enrichment</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>Rabbits are highly intelligent and are often misunderstood due to their quiet nature. They need lots of stimulation to prevent them from getting bored. These don’t need to be expensive toys. <br><br>

A great bunny toy is a simple cardboard box, just cut two door holes in it and they will happily explore it and enjoy “renovating” (chewing their own holes)! A cardboard tube/empty toilet roll or egg box stuffed with hay and a few raisins makes a great toy, as do fabric tunnels. They also love digging and jumping so fill a box with soil or try giving them a sandpit.</p></div>


<h2 class="controle">Socialisation/Rabbit Bonding</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>Rabbits are very social animals and thrive with company of their own kind. In the wild they live in large colonies and this social side of their nature is still very evident in the domestic rabbit. At WRR we don’t believe any rabbit should live alone. This is partly for its mental health; they need interaction and a friend for company, but also for their physical wellbeing. Rabbits are very clean animals and will ‘groom’ each other. This is also a sign of affection between rabbits.<br><br>

Rabbits are however also very territorial. You can’t simply put two rabbits together and expect them to get along. As a general rule the best pairing for rabbits is a desexed male and a desexed female, but this is not always the case. Some same sex pairs can get along great, as can groups of three, four or more rabbits - given the right conditions. 
Young rabbits housed together will often begin to fight when they reach sexual maturity and if the fighting leads to biting or any skin injury they need to be separated until they are desexed.<br><br>

WRR help to ‘bond’ rabbits. Bonding involves introducing rabbits on neutral territory; where neither rabbit has been before, for short periods of time depending on how they get along. For more information on bonding two rabbits please contact us or see the link below.</p></div>


<h2 class="controle">The Rabbit Human Relationship</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>Rabbits are prey animals and contrary to popular belief, most do not like being picked up. This is because to a rabbit, being picked up off the ground is similar to being caught by a predator.<br><br>

Rabbits do however like receiving attention with all four legs on the ground. They love having their heads and ears stroked and many like their cheeks rubbed.<br><br>

You do however often need to earn a rabbit’s trust. A good way to let your rabbit know you aren’t a threat or a predator is just to spend time with it. Get down to their level and sit or lie down in their pen, allow them to come to you in their own time. This may take some time but it’s worth being patient. Rabbits love treats like dried fruit so try hand feeding them one or two morsels when you sit with them. They will soon start to associate you with treats and before too long will run up to you and allow you to pat them.</p></div>

<h2 class="controle">Desexing</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>All WRR rabbits are desexed before adoption. We believe ALL rabbits should be desexed &amp; vaccinated. There are many, many reasons why having your rabbit desexed is a good idea. Here are a few…<br><br>

- There are too many unwanted rabbits in animal shelters all over the New Zealand Unfortunately a huge number of healthy rabbits are euthanised each day because there are not enough homes or spaces in shelters for them. Desexing your rabbit means preventing more animals suffering this fate. (In saying that - WRR never euthanises rabbits unless they are too sick or injured to survive and it is in their best interest. This decision is never taken lightly.)<br><br>

- Rabbits breed like rabbits and they are very virile; a female rabbit can have up to 10 babies per litter and can get pregnant again as soon as she has given birth. It is very important to desex your female rabbit even if she is not housed with a male rabbit. For example - we have many cases where unspeyed female rabbits become pregnant to wild male rabbits. Wild rabbits can break into a female rabbits cage or if the female is feeling very hormonal she may even break or dig her way out!<br><br>

- Desexing your rabbit also prevents health problems in the future… female rabbits for example are extremely prone to uterine cancer, which is fatal.<br><br>

 - Rabbit’s are very hormonal creatures and being entire (not desexed) can cause them mental stress. They are likely to pace, spray, dig and just be destructive in general. Desexing your rabbit helps relax their temperament. It also helps prevent female rabbits from having ‘false pregnancies’ which are very, very common. A false pregnancy can drive a rabbit to pull out her fur, make a nest and even produce milk which is all very stressful on a her body. This can happen even if you have NO male rabbits around.<br><br>

Desexed rabbits are also a lot easier to bond. They are less territorial and enjoy the company of other rabbits without the hormonal stress.</p></div>


<h2 class="controle">Rabbit Health</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>Rabbits are quite fragile creatures and as prey animals they hide pain and injury well. They do this so as not to draw attention to themselves (from potential predators). This means that often by the time your rabbit shows outward signs of illness it could be very serious!<br><br>

Here are some common problems rabbits in New Zealand face:

<h3>RHD/Calici Virus:</h3>
Rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD), also known as haemorrhagic viral disease (RHVD), is a disease that kills rabbits. It was illegally introduced into New Zealand in 1997.  Thirty to eighty percent of animals exposed to the virus will develop the disease. Almost 100% of infected animals will die.  
It is unsure how the virus is transmitted, but at this stage it is assumed that rabbits acquire this highly infectious virus by breathing it in, ingestion, direct contact or through infected urine or faeces. Insects are also able to carry the virus, so isolation from other rabbits is not enough to prevent this nasty disease affecting your rabbit.  The incubation period is 1-3 days and research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are usually resistant to the virus. There are three forms of the disease which, in severe cases, causes bleeding in the lungs, the windpipe, liver, spleen, kidneys and the heart.<br><br>

1. Death without any other signs.

2. Depression, anorexia, difficulty breathing, shaking, and death within one to two days.  Other signs may include a foamy or bloody discharge from the nose or anus, nervous signs or rapid death. Rabbits may appear to recover, then die several days later.<br><br>

3. Mild form – depression, anorexia followed by recovery. These animals become immune from re-infection
Rabbits can be vaccinated from 6 weeks old, at which age they will require boosters every 3 to 4 weeks until they are 3 months old. If vaccination commences at 2.5-3 months old, they will not require another booster that year. In order to maintain immunity, it is recommended that all vaccinated rabbits receive an annual booster.<br><br>


<h3>Gut Stasis:</h3>
If your rabbit stops eating or appears to be off its food it is imperative you keep a very close eye on them. If a rabbit stops eating his gut may go into stasis and this can be fatal within just 24hrs. If you put down their favourite food and they turn their nose up at it take them straight to a rabbit savvy vet.<br><br>

<h3>Coccidia/Diarrhoea:</h3>
Diarrhoea is often a sign of gut problems in your rabbit and can also be a sign of coccidia. Keep a close eye on any rabbit with diarrohea and encourage them to eat hay and/or grass for the high fibre content.<br><br>

<h3>A rabbit’s teeth:</h3>
A rabbit’s teeth grow continuously throughout its life and it is vital they eat high fibre food to wear these down. Sometimes a rabbit’s teeth can grow and develop spurs which cut into the their mouth, these will eventually stop your rabbit from eating. If you notice your rabbit is off its food or has a wet chin or any swelling around the face/mouth take it straight to a rabbit savvy vet.<br><br>

<h3>Flystrike:</h3>
Rabbits with runny poos/diarrhoea or injuries (infected wounds in particular) can be prone to flystrike, particularly in summer. Flystrike occurs when the fly lays its eggs in the poo around the rabbit’s bottom or near/in the any wounds your rabbit might have. The eggs then hatch into maggots which burrow into and eat the skin of the rabbit causing severe pain and often death from shock. Flystrike rarely if ever affects healthy rabbits. It is VERY important to keep your rabbit clean if it has diarrhoea. You can do this by clipping the rabbit’s fur around its bottom and keeping the area clean. Please DO NOT bath your rabbit and check with your rabbit savvy vet if you wish to use shampoo to clean your rabbit’s bottom. We only use Whoop Itch &amp; Ouch shampoo on rabbits here at WRR and only when the situation is dire! Rabbits cannot regulate their body temperature well and when bathing a rabbit the water penetrates right through the fur; unlike rain, which runs off their fur and doesn’t penetrate right through to the skin. It is important to check your rabbit for flystrike in the summer months. If your rabbit has any signs of flystrike take it straight to a rabbit savvy vet!


<h3>Heatstroke:</h3>
Rabbits do not cope well in the heat and need a helping hand in the summer months. Always ensure your rabbit has shade and plenty of water. A good idea is to wet towels and hang them as shade cloths - the moisture in the towels helps to cool the air.
A good trick is to freeze water bottles and then place them in your rabbit’s hutch or run for them to lie next to on hot days, you can wrap the bottle in a tea towel.<br><br>
 
A fun way to keep your rabbit cool &amp; give him enrichment at the same time is to freeze pieces of fresh fruit with water in ice cube trays which are like popsicles when popped out and given to your bunny a few at a time!<br><br>
 
If you rabbit is indoors ensure the curtains are pulled to give them shade and you can use a fan to keep the air flowing and cool.<br><br>


<h3>Pastuerella/Rabbit Snuffles:</h3>
All rabbits carry a bacteria in their respiratory tract called Pastuerella. Some rabbits are more susceptible to the symptoms of this bacteria and some only develop symptoms in times of stress or ill health. <br><br>

The pastuerella bacteria can cause your rabbit to have cold like symptoms. Some rabbits get over this quite quickly on their own, but sometimes it can develop quickly into a more serious or recurring illness of the respiratory tract. If you notice your rabbit is sneezing, look out for it producing any mucus from the nose or eyes. Rabbits often use their front paws to wipe their faces so if you see mucus on their front feet this is a tell-tale sign. <br><br>

Take your bunny to see a rabbit savvy vet if your rabbit has mucus, appears lethargic or as with all other rabbit illnesses – if he stops eating/pooing/peeing!</p></div>

<h2 class="controle">Orphaned Baby Rabbits</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>Baby rabbits are notoriously hard to hand rear. Due to their delicate gut systems many baby rabbits never adjust to the change in diet when they stop having mum’s milk and move onto something else. Never take a baby rabbit from his/her mum before the age of 6 weeks – the recommended age is 8-10 weeks. However if mum is definitely not coping, then 6 weeks should be the minimum and they should be kept where you can keep a close eye on them.<br><br>

IF the only option is to bottle-feed then you should contact your local rabbit savvy vet or contact Wellington Rabbit Rescue via our Facebook page so we can talk you through it.<br><br>

<h3>Feeding Orphaned Babies:</h3>

The best kind of rabbit milk replacer available in New Zealand is Wombaroo Rabbit Milk Replacer. If you can’t get hold of that then you can use VitaPet Pet Milk (this is available at the supermarket) but it’s not recommended for babies under 10 days old as it really doesn’t have all the vital nutrients they need for those first few days! You can also use puppy or kitten milk replacer – but you may find the rabbit does not adjust to the change from rabbit milk to puppy or kitten.<br><br>

If the rabbit is newborn (without hair, has not received even one feed from mum) then you MUST get your hands on some colostrum! The first day of feeds should be colostrum and then you wean your baby off the colostrum and onto the milk replacer on the second day.<br><br>

Rabbits tend to chew through teats so the best and most safe way to feed a baby rabbit is to use a 1ml syringe for the first 7-10 days. You need to ensure the rabbit NEVER inhales the milk. You drip the milk in very slowly and make sure the rabbit is swallowing all you are putting into his mouth because they cannot regurgitate any milk that isn’t swallowed and can choke to death.<br><br>

Once your baby has his eyes open (around 7-10 days) you can move up to a 3-5ml syringe and give them two large feeds a day. This is how mum rabbit would naturally feed them.<br><br>

Here is a feeding guideline but a couple of mls either side is also okay:</p>

</table>

<p>This guideline is based on the use of Wombaroo Rabbit Milk Replacer. If you are feeding with something with fewer nutrients your bunny may need more than the amount suggested on the table above.<br><br>

When you feed your rabbit always ensure they are sitting upright as they would feed from their mother. It’s best to keep all four feet on the ground – but wiggly baby rabbits don’t always cooperate. NEVER hold them upside down to feed as they cannot breathe well like that and will more than likely inhale the milk.<br><br>

When your baby has finished feeding use a warm damp cotton bud and gently rub over the rabbit’s bottom to encourage them to toilet. It’s important that rabbits are pooing/peeing after 12 hours – if they do not – go straight to a rabbit savvy vet.<br><br>

The best way to keep a baby rabbit warm is other baby rabbits. You can keep them in a warm dry place inside a cardboard box (with some air holes in the top) and this should keep them warm enough. Single babies are a little trickier… you can use a heat pad, wheat pack or hot water bottle to keep them warm, but rabbits can overheat VERY fast. So never put them directly on a heat pad. It’s best to make a nest and have the heat pad somewhere near the nest to keep the baby warm without him getting trapped on the heat pad and over-heating.</p>
