		<div id="policy">
			<p>If you want to adopt through Wellington Rabbit Rescue you will need to have an inspection of your yard/enclosure/room. <br><br>

				If you are using a hutch it must be 2 metres (length) 1 metre (width) and 1 metre (height) with a warm, dry house that is at least 61x61cm. This is our minimum standard -- the bigger the better! <br><br>

				We don’t adopt out single rabbits unless they are going to be a companion to your existing rabbit :) We feel it’s not fair to keep a rabbit all on their own as they are very social creatures and thrive with their own kind for company. There are exceptions of course… for example if you work from home and adopt an indoor-bunny.
				</p>

		<div id="priceing">
			<P>If you are adopting a rabbit as a companion for your existing rabbit then you will need to bring them out to have a "meet & greet" with the WRR rabbit you would like to adopt!<br><br>

			Rabbits can live until they are 10-12years. You need to be ready to care for your rabbit for this long. This includes annual health checks and vaccinations. <br><br>

			The adoption fee is $60 for one rabbit or $100 for a pair. This money goes towards the desexing and vaccinating of our bunnies. (It’s $140 for a male to be desexed &amp; $210 for a female)!<br><br>

			If for some reason you can no longer care for your rabbit you must return it to us.</P>
